# Arobi Live Ledger Receipt

This page is generated from the live public Arobi status and ledger endpoints plus the latest supervised fabric audit rerun on the controller. It exists to answer a simple question: did a fresh governed audit record actually land on the public Arobi Network node and surface on aura-genesis?

## Plain-English Readout

- The public aura-genesis status and ledger surfaces are reading the live 3.3.1 Arobi node, not a stale local-only file.
- The latest supervised rerun `fabric-audit-soak-20260420T022653Z` still shows a public delta of `1` and a private delta of `1`, but no fresh governed record is visible through the current public edge.
- The latest visible public record does not match the latest local rerun receipt.

## Truth Boundary

- This page is a live-node receipt, not a benchmark score.
- It is generated from the public aura-genesis status and ledger endpoints plus the latest local supervised fabric-audit rerun receipt.
- The public visible record currently comes from the latest governed audit record surfaced on the public ledger feed.
- At generation time, the public aura-genesis telemetry edge was reachable enough to compare the latest visible public record against the latest supervised rerun.
- This page does not expose secrets, raw private payloads, or raw chain-of-thought.
